# Equation time!

How can we convert the metrics to a confusion matrix? First of all, we have to agree on a scaling. Any scaling is OK, but using M = 100 is simpler and will allow to think in terms of percentages. You can use as well M = 1000, 100,000 or any other number.
We need to obtain the following numbers:
* $P$: number of positive cases
* $TP$: true positive cases
* $TN$: true negative cases

From the definitions, we have:
* Accuracy: $Acc = (TP + TN) / M$
* Precision: $Prec = TP / (TP + FP)$
* Recall: $Rec = TP / (TP + FN)$

So we obtain:
* $P = $
* $TP = $
* $TN = $
