# Confusion Matrix

## Everything you wanted to know and were afraid to ask

This web app will try to demistify the terminology used in classification systems, 
like confusion matrix and prediction metrics (accuracy, recall, type I/II error, et cetera). 

I guarantee you'll learn something new even if you're familiar with the terminology already.

And no, we won't make the tired joke on taking the confusion out of the confusion matrix... because we would end up with just a matrix ;)
