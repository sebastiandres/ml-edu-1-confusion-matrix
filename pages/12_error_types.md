# Type I and type II errors

IMAGE in depth

false positive or error type I
false negative or error type II
true positive
true negative

Remebering error type I and II can be confusing. Again, the naming is just a convention, and I have found that the best way to remember is this picture by XYZ:

type i // type ii error.

Notice that the importance of type I (false positive) and type II errors (false negative) depend on the total number of samples and the class balance!

Examples:
FP = 10, FN = 20, M = 100, P/N = .2
FP = 10, FN = 20, M = 100, P/N = .5
FP = 10, FN = 20, M = 100, P/N = .8
FP = 10, FN = 20, M = 1000, P/N = .2
FP = 10, FN = 20, M = 1000, P/N = .51
FP = 10, FN = 20, M = 1000, P/N = .8
